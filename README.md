# Homecraft Retail lab script: build an e-commerce search bar with Elastic ESRE and Google's GenAI

This is the step-by-step guide for enablement hands-on labs, and refers to the code repo [https://github.com/rishikeshr/homecraft_vertex](https://github.com/rishikeshr/homecraft_vertex)

## Configuration steps

1. Sign-up to a [free trial account](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup) of Elastic (or alternatively subscribe via GCP MP)
2. Setup your Elastic cluster:
   - select a GCP region, the latest Elastic version, Autoscaling set to "None"
   - 1-zone 360GB Hot node
   - 1-zone 4GB Machine Learning node
   - 1-zone 4GB Kibana node
   - 1-zone 4GB Enterprise Search
   - Leave everything else as it is by default
   - Create the cluster and download/note down the username/password

3. As a first step we need to prepare our Elastic ML nodes to create text-embedding out of content we will be indexing. We just need to load our transformer model of choice into Elastic and start it. This can be done through the [Eland Client](https://github.com/elastic/eland). We will use the [all-distillroberta-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1) ML model. To run Eland client you need docker installed. An easy way to accomplish this step without python/docker installation is via Google's Cloud Shell. Be sure the eland version you're cloning is compatible with the Elastic version you choose (e.g. generally eland 8.11 works with elastic cloud 8.11)! If you used the latest Elastic version, there's generally no need to specify the Eland release version while cloning.
   - Enter Google Cloud console.
   - Open the Cloud Shell editor (you can use [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshelleditor?cloudshell=true))
   - Enter the following commands. Take a look at the last one: you have to specify your Elastic username and password previously found + the elastic endpoint (find it at Elatic admin home -> "Manage" button on your deployment --> "Copy endpoint" on the Elasticsearch line)
  
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/elastic/eland.git #use -b vX.X.X option for specific eland version. This lab is tested with v8.3

cd eland/

docker build -t elastic/eland .

docker run -it --rm elastic/eland eland_import_hub_model --url https://<elastic_user>:<elastic_password>@<your_elastic_endpoint>:9243/ --hub-model-id sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1 --start
 ```
4. After the model finishes loading into Elastic, enter your deployment and from the left menu go to "Stack Management" -> "Machine Learning". You should notice the all-distilroberta-v1 model listed and in the "started" status. If a "out of sync" warning is shown, click on it and sync. Everything should be now set. Our ML model is up-and-running. We now are able to apply our transformer model to the documents we are going to ingest.
   
5. Let's start with indexing some general retail data from the Ikea website. We will use the built-in web crawler feature, configure it this way:
   - Search for "Web Crawler" in the Elastic search bar
   - Name the new index as "search-homecraft-ikea" (watch out the "search-" prefix is already there) and go next screen.
   - Specify "https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/" in the domain URL field and click "Validate Domain". A warning should appear, saying that a robots.txt file was found. Click on it to open it in a separate browser tab and continue by clicking "Add domain"
   - For better crawling performance search the sitemap.xml filepath inside the robots.txt file of the target webserver, and add its path to the Site Maps tab.
   - To avoid crawling too many pages and stick with the english ones we can define some crawl rules. Set as follows (rule order counts!):
     
     ![image](https://github.com/rishikeshr/homecraft_vertex_lab/assets/122872322/1f0d52cc-2d01-4b5d-9c0e-927042ccd932)

6. Now the new empty index should be automatically created for you. Have a look at it:
   - From the left panel, in the "Enterprise Search" section, select "Content" and click on index to explore its details.
   - You can also query it from the "Management" -> "Dev Tools" UI with the following query
     ```bash
     #Query index config
     GET search-homecraft-ikea 
     #Query index content
      GET search-homecraft-ikea/_search

7. Before start crawling we need to attach an ingest pipeline to the newly create index, so every time a new document is indexed, it will be processed by our ML model that will enrich the document with an additional field, the vector representation of its content.
   - Open the index from the Enterprise Search UI and navigate to the "Pipelines" tab
   - Click on "Copy and customize" to create a custom pipeline associated to this index
   - In the Machine Learning section click on "Add Inference Pipeline"
   - Name the pipeline as "ml-inference-title-vector"
   - Select your transformer model and go next screen
   - Select the "Source field". This is the field that the ML model will process to create vectors from, and the UI suggests the ones automatically created from the web crawler. Select the "title" field as source field, leave everything as default and go on until pipeline is created.
  
8. Check the newly created ingest pipeline searching for it from the "Stack Management" -> "Ingest pipelines" section. You are able to analyze the processors (the processing tasks) listed in the pipeline and add/remove/modify them. Note also that you can specify exception handlers.

9. Before launching the crawler we need to set the mappings for the target field where the vetors will be stored, specifying the "title-vector" field is of type "dense_vector", vector dimensions and its similarity algorithm. Let's execute the mapping API from the Dev Tools:

```bash
POST search-homecraft-ikea/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "title-vector": {
      "type": "dense_vector",
      "dims": 768,
      "index": true,
      "similarity": "dot_product"
    }
  }
}
```

10. Start crawling: go back on the index and click on the "Start Crawling" button on the top right corner of the page. You will see the document count slowly increasing while the web crawler runs.

11. Let's now ingest a product catalog, to let our users search for products via hybrid search (keywords + semantics):
    - Load into Elastic this [Home Depot product catalog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/the-home-depot-products-dataset) via the "Upload File" feature (search for it in the top search bar). Click on "Import" and name the index "home-depot-product-catalog"
    - Take a look at the document structure, the fields available and their content. You will notice there are title and descriptions fields as well. We will apply the inference on the title field, so we can reuse the previously created ingest pipeline
    - From the Dev Tools console create a new empty index that will host the dense vectors called "home-depot-product-catalog-vector" and specify mappings.

```bash
PUT /home-depot-product-catalog-vector 

POST home-depot-product-catalog-vector/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "title-vector": {
      "type": "dense_vector",
      "dims": 768,
      "index": true,
      "similarity": "dot_product"
    }
  }
}
```

   - Re-index the product dataset through the same ingest pipeline previously created for the web-crawler. The new index will now have vectors embedded in documents in the title-vector field.

```bash
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "home-depot-product-catalog"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "home-depot-product-catalog-vector",
    "pipeline": "ml-inference-title-vector"
  }
}
```
  

  - (Note that we used these steps to show how to use reindexing and ingest pipelines via API. You can still apply the pipelines via UI as done before with the search-homecraft-ikea index)

12. To complete our data baseline we can also import an e-commerce order history. Leverage the BigQuery to Elasticsearch Dataflow's [native integration](https://www.elastic.co/blog/ingest-data-directly-from-google-bigquery-into-elastic-using-google-dataflow) to move this [sample e-commerce dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce?project=elastic-sa) into Elastic. Be aware the UI and available fields/label may visually change on Dataflow depending on the region you choose, but it should work regardlessly. This lab was tested with us-central1 region.
    - Click on "View Dataset" after reaching the Google Console with the previous link
    - Take a look at the tables available in this dataset within the BigQuery explorer UI. On the left panel open the "thelook_ecommerce" dataset and click on the "Order_items" table. Explore the content
    - Copy the ID (by clicking on the 3 dots) of the "Order_items" table and search for Dataflow in the Google Cloud service search bar
    - Create a new Dataflow job from template, selecting the "BigQuery to Elasticsearch" built-in template. You will need to specify:
       - The job's name
       - The region to run the job in (preferably choose the same you deployed the Elastic cluster in to minimize latencies and costs)
       - The Elastic cluster's "cloudID"
       - The Elastic API key to let Dataflow connect with Elastic(check [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-api-keys.html) how to generate one)
       - The index name as "bigquery-thelook-order-items". Dataflow will automatically create this new index where all the table lines will be sent.
       - The dataset and table you want to read from (first field of the Optional Parameters): bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items (some regions need bigquery-public-data:thelook_ecommerce.order_items instead - : after project name instead of .)
       - Elastic username and password
       - Launch the job
      
![image](https://github.com/rishikeshr/homecraft_vertex_lab/assets/122872322/8708b87f-5855-447d-b6de-db7632a515cb)


This will let users to submit queries for their past orders. We are not creating embeddings on this index because keyword search will suffice (e.g. searching for userID, productID). Wait for the job to complete and check the data is correctly indexed in Elastic from the indices list in the UI.

13. Let's test a Vector Search query directly from the Kibana Dev Tools. We will later see this embedded in our app. You can copy paste the following query from [this file](https://github.com/rishikeshr/homecraft_vertex/blob/main/Additional%20sources/helpful_elastic_api_calls). 

![image](https://github.com/rishikeshr/homecraft_vertex_lab/assets/122872322/1a6e0079-7b51-4791-adfe-6b863037a9b5)

We are executing the classic "_search" API call, to query documents in Elasticsearch. The Semantic Search component is provided by the "knn" clause, where we specify the field we want to search vectors into (title-vector), the number of relevant documents we want to extract and the user provided query. Note that, to compare vectors also the user query has to be translated into text-embeddings from our ML model. We are then specifying the "text_embedding" field in the API call: this will let create vectors on-the-fly on the user query and compare them with the stored documents.
The "query" clause, instead, will enable keyword search on the same elastic index. This way we are using both techniques but still receiving an unified output.
      
14. We are now going to deploy our front-end app. Create a small Google Cloud Compute Engine linux machine with default settings, with public IPv4 address enabled (set it in the Advanced Settings -> Networking), HTTP and HTTPS traffic enabled (tick the checkboxes) and access it via SSH. This will be used as our web-server for the front-end application, hosting our "intelligent search bar". We suggest these settings:
    - e2-medium
    - Debian11  

15. Update the machine, install git, python and pip.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install git #Press Y if prompted
sudo apt install pip #Press Y if prompted

#Check if python is installed (it probably is).
python3 --version
#If not python version is found install it
sudo apt install python3

```

16. Clone the [homecraft_vertex source-code repo](https://github.com/rishikeshr/homecraft_vertex) on your CE machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishikeshr/homecraft_vertex.git
```

17. Install requirements needed to run the app from the requirements.txt file. After this step, close the SSH session and reopen it, to ensure all the $PATH variables are refreshed (otherwise you can get a "streamlit command not found" error). You can have a look at the requirements.txt file content via vim/nano or your favourite editor.

```bash
cd homecraft_vertex
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

18. Authenticate the machine to the VertexAI SDK (installed via the requirements.txt file) and follow the instructions.
```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
```

19. Set up the environment variables cloud_id (the elastic CloudID - find it on the Elastic admin console), cloud_pass and cloud_user (Elastic deployments's user details) and gcp_project_id (the GCP project you're working in). This variables are used inside of the app code to reference the correct systems to communicate with (Elastic cluster and VertexAI API in your GCP project)

```bash
export cloud_id='<replaceHereYourElasticCloudID>'
export cloud_user='elastic'
export cloud_pass='<replaceHereYourElasticDeploymentPassword>'
export gcp_project_id='<replaceHereTheGCPProjectID>'
```

20. Run the app and access it copying the public IP:PORT the console will display in a web browser page
```bash
streamlit run homecraft_home.py
```

21. Test your app!

## Web-app code explanation

To fully understand how genAI models are used and how to integrate with VertexAI and PALM2 models have a look at the web-app code.
The application is built with a easy-to-start python framework called "streamlit", it allows simple and fast front-end development for prototyping and demos.

Most of the code is in the "homecraft_home.py" file, that we have referenced in the "run" command to startup the application. Additional pages can be found in the "pages" folder, which routing is automatically managed by streamlit. In the "homecraft_finetuned.py" page you can find the code to call a custom fine-tuned version of text-bison-001, re-trained via VertexAI. For more information about fine-tuning check [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/models/tune-models#generative-ai-tune-model-python).

Let's briefly describe the source code:

- The first lines will be importing the requried libraries. "streamlit" for the app structure, "elasticsearch" for abstracting the API calls and connections with the Elastic cluster, and "vertexAI", the Google's SDK for interacting with all the GenAI models and tools. As previously seen, we had to authenticate our machine for programmatic access to Google services to let our app call VertexAI APIs.

```bash
import os
import streamlit as st
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
import vertexai
from vertexai.language_models import TextGenerationModel
```

- We then set internal variables reading the environment ones we previously defined for the credentials/endpoints of Elastic and GCP project. Those will be used to setup the connections later.

```bash
projid = os.environ['gcp_project_id']
cid = os.environ['cloud_id']
cp = os.environ['cloud_pass']
cu = os.environ['cloud_user']
```

- With the following settings we are configuring our GenAI model. We define which model we want to use, model's creativity and output lenght and we initialize the sdk.

```bash
parameters = {
    "temperature": 0.4, # 0 - 1. The higher the temp the more creative and less on point answers become
    "max_output_tokens": 606, #modify this number (1 - 1024) for short/longer answers
    "top_p": 0.8,
    "top_k": 40
}
vertexai.init(project=projid, location="us-central1")
model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained("text-bison@001")
```

- From line 37 to 172 we set the connection with the Elastic cluster and define methods executing three main API calls: 
a. search_products: use semantic search to find products in the HomeDepot dataset;
b. search_docs: use semantic search to find general retail information from the Ikea web-crawled index;
c. search_orders: search past user orders by keyword search.

- The real magic happens in the following code. Here we capture the user input from the web form, we execute search queries on Elastic and the use the responses to fill the variables into the pre-defined prompt, meant to be sent to our GenAI model.

```bash
# Generate and display response on form submission
negResponse = "I'm unable to answer the question based on the information I have from Homecraft dataset."
if submit_button:
    es = es_connect(cid, cu, cp)
    resp_products, url_products = search_products(query)
    resp_docs, url_docs = search_docs(query)
    resp_order_items = search_orders(1) # 1 is the hardcoded userid, to simplify this scenario. You should take user_id by user session
    prompt = f"Answer this question: {query}.\n If product information is requested use the information provided in this JSON: {resp_products} listing the identified products in bullet points with this format: Product name, product key features, price, web url. \n For other questions use the documentation provided in these docs: {resp_docs} and your own knowledge. \n If the question contains requests for user past orders consider the following order list: {resp_order_items}"
    answer = vertexAI(prompt)

    if answer.strip() == '':
        st.write(f"Search Assistant: \n\n{answer.strip()}")
    else:
        st.write(f"Search Assistant: \n\n{answer.strip()}\n\n")
```

## Sample questions

---USE THE HOME PAGE FOR BASE DEMO---

Try queries like: 

- "List the 3 top paint primers in the product catalog, specify also the sales price for each product and product key features. Then explain in bullet points how to use a paint primer".
You can also try asking for related urls and availability --> leveraging private product catalog + public knowledge

- "could you please list the available stores in UK" --> --> it will likely use (crawled docs)

- "Which are the ways to contact customer support in the UK? What is the webpage url for customer support?" --> it will likely use crawled docs

- Please provide the social media accounts info from the company --> it will likely use crawled docs

- Please provide the full address of the Manchester store in UK --> it will likely use crawled docs

- are you offering a free parcel delivery? --> it will likely use crawled docs

- Could you please list my past orders? Please specify price for each product --> it will search into BigQuery order dataset

- List all the items I have bought in my order history in bullet points


---FOR A DEMO OF FINE-TUNED MODEL USE "HOMECRAFT FINETUNED" WEBPAGE---

Try "Anyone available at Homecraft to assist with painting my house?".
Asking this question in the fine-tuned page should suggest to go with Homecraft's network of professionals

Asking the same to the base model will likely provide a generic or "unable to help" answer.
